# Detecting-face-emotion-using-CNN
A Deep Learning based end to end project of detecting emotion of human face using Facial expression detection dataset from kaggle. Here I used a CNN model and trained it to predict the facial expression. And to make this preject interactive i followed two strategy. First i made a web app using Flask(backend) and basic html(frontend). And Secondly use computer vision to make it real time.
